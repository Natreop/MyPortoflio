          SAE 1.01, Management internship.
        </p>

        <p>
          A team compound of Léo Grisard-Dubois and Thomas Bouquier.
        </p>
        <h3>Mission:</h3>
        <p>
          This project aims to develop a command-line application for managing internships in a fictitious environment. The application will be designed to run in a computer terminal and will be written in the C programming language. The application will be divided into three main sections, each serving a different purpose and user group.

          The first section will be devoted to the management of students. This section will allow students to create a new profile and submit internship requests. Students will be able to view their current internship status, update their personal information, and communicate with internship managers regarding their application.

          The second section will be dedicated to the management of internship managers. This section will allow managers to create new internships, review internship requests, and communicate with students regarding their applications. Managers will also be able to promulgate internships, which means they can officially announce and assign internships to students. This section will provide managers with a comprehensive view of all internships, including their status and the students assigned to them.

          The third and final section will be reserved for the jury. The jury will be responsible for evaluating the internships and assigning grades to the students. This section will allow the jury to view the internship details, including the student's work and any feedback from the internship manager. The jury will also have the ability to enter grades and submit them for official recording.

          Overall, this command-line application will provide a streamlined and efficient way to manage internships in a fictitious environment. By dividing the application into three distinct sections, it will be easy for students, managers, and jurors to navigate and use the application to perform their respective tasks. The use of the C programming language will ensure that the application is fast, reliable, and compatible with a wide range of computer systems.

          This project aims to develop a command-line apllication game.
          The application will be designed to run in a computer terminal and will be written in the C programming language.
          The game takes place that we have a menu which asks for the player's nickname and the associated password, this gives access to a menu which has the option of launching a game with the basic campaign, of creating a new world to add to a campaign, look at the scores sorted by player name or by increasing score, search for a player by name and then there is an option to play a custom campaign with the world added before.

          This SAÉ allows you to experience workstation installation missions under Linux, as well as to become familiar with maintenance.
          The list of knowledge is provided and is divided into two parts corresponding to each period. All of the acquired procedures must be able to be automated and must therefore not depend on a graphical tool.
