            <li>PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It's a language that allows you to create server-side web scripts to produce dynamic web pages. This language enables me to retrieve information from the site and create pages that react to changes related, for example, to registrations.</li>
            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's a language that allows you to structure web pages and include their content. This language enables me to create websites and structure them as I wish.</li>

        <h2>Flaw</h2>
        <p>
          <h3>Procrastination: </h3>
          Procrastination is the act of delaying work or tasks until the last minute. Unfortunately, I struggle with this flaw, as it delays my work and causes me to accumulate a backlog of things to do. I am aware of it and try to improve by tackling the most unpleasant tasks first and working ahead on stressful factors. I strive to be as rigorous as possible. Additionally, I am improving in this area thanks to close deadlines and the advance work I do on tasks. I try to take a clear-eyed view, which results in two advantages: less work at the last minute and less damage overall. However, I still procrastinate to some extent.

          <h3>Lack of Confidence: </h3>
          Lack of confidence is the inability to believe in oneself and one's abilities. It means putting oneself below others. I find it difficult because I can't accept criticism, whether I do well or poorly, which affects my results and reputation among others. I am conscious of this and try to face challenges that allow me to take control. Thanks to this fear, I have gained some confidence, but I still lack a great deal of it.

          <h3>Susceptibility:</h3>
          Susceptibility is the inability to accept remarks or criticism, even if they are justified. It can lead to regret or anger. I find it difficult because it can ruin my life. I doubt others who question my personality and actions. However, I shouldn't take it to heart and should take a step back. I need to learn to accept constructive criticism and question myself.
