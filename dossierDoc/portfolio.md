# Welcome to my portfolio

My name is Grisard-Dubois Léo, and I am a student at Clermont Auvergne University in the first year of BUT Computer science. I am able to carry out web development, algorithms in C and Python languages, simple Linux and database management, from design to SQL scripting. Creativity, persistence in my work, listening to others and seriousness are some of my qualities. I am looking for a 10-week internship in the Computer Science field, in application development, which will start in April 2025.

## Skills and quality

### My skills

![Jauge_Web](images/jauge75.png)

* Web development: CSS, PHP, HTML
  * CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language that describes the appearance and presentation of HTML pages. With this language, I can modify the appearance of a website and make it visually and graphically better.
  * PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It's a language that allows you to create server-side web scripts to produce dynamic web pages. This language enables me to retrieve information from the site and create pages that react to changes related, for example, to registrations.
  * HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's a language that allows you to structure web pages and include their content. This language enables me to create websites and structure them as I wish.

* Databases: design and SQL
  * Database design consists of organizing data in an Entity/Relationship model and associations. This skill enables me to model databases and represent them in several forms to make them understandable to everyone.
  * SQL (Structured Query Language) translates to "Structured Query Language." It's a language used to manipulate and exploit relational databases. This language enables me to create databases and manipulate them to obtain the results I want.

![Jauge_Algorithms](images/jauge50.png)

* Algorithms: C and Python language
  * C is a programming language that offers significant control over memory. It's the base language for many modern software and languages. C allows me to create algorithms and algorithmic systems.
  * Python is an interpreted low-level programming language. Python, like C, enables me to create programs and systems.

## Flaws

### Procrastination

Procrastination is the act of delaying work or tasks until the last minute. Unfortunately, I struggle with this flaw, as it delays my work and causes me to accumulate a backlog of things to do. I am aware of it and try to improve by tackling the most unpleasant tasks first and working ahead on stressful factors. I strive to be as rigorous as possible. Additionally, I am improving in this area thanks to close deadlines and the advance work I do on tasks. I try to take a clear-eyed view, which results in two advantages: less work at the last minute and less damage overall. However, I still procrastinate to some extent.

### Lack of Confidence

Lack of confidence is the inability to believe in oneself and one's abilities. It means putting oneself below others. I find it difficult because I can't accept criticism, whether I do well or poorly, which affects my results and reputation among others. I am conscious of this and try to face challenges that allow me to take control. Thanks to this fear, I have gained some confidence, but I still lack a great deal of it.

### Susceptibility

Susceptibility is the inability to accept remarks or criticism, even if they are justified. It can lead to regret or anger. I find it difficult because it can ruin my life. I doubt others who question my personality and actions. However, I shouldn't take it to heart and should take a step back. I need to learn to accept constructive criticism and question myself.

## List of my projects

### SAE 1.01, Management internship

#### Context

A team compound of Léo Grisard-Dubois and Thomas Bouquier.

#### Mission

This project aims to develop a command-line application for managing internships in a fictitious environment. The application will be designed to run in a computer terminal and will be written in the C programming language. The application will be divided into three main sections, each serving a different purpose and user group.

#### Results

The result it the grade at the end of the project.

### SAE 1.02, Comparison of algorithmic approaches

#### Context

A team compound of Léo Grisard-Dubois and Thomas Bouquier.

#### Mission

This project aims to develop a command-line apllication game. The application will be designed to run in a computer terminal and will be written in the C programming language. The game takes place that we have a menu which asks for the player's nickname and the associated password, this gives access to a menu which has the option of launching a game with the basic campaign, of creating a new world to add to a campaign, look at the scores sorted by player name or by increasing score, search for a player by name and then there is an option to play a custom campaign with the world added before.

#### Results

The result it the grade at the end of the project.

### SAE 1.03, Installation of a workstation for development

#### Context

This work is done alone.

#### Mission

This SAÉ allows you to experience workstation installation missions under Linux, as well as to become familiar with maintenance. The list of knowledge is provided and is divided into two parts corresponding to each period.
